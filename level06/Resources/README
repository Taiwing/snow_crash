First create a file wich contains an expression that will be evaluted by the
'/e' regex, meaning that it should match the regex and contain php code to be
evaluated. Use $z for this. $z is simply the second argument of the ./level06
command.

So, with the payload file created as /tmp/payload (that contains the expression to be
evaluated), run this:

./level06 /tmp/payload 'shell_exec("getflag > /tmp/flag");'

And boom! you get the flag in /tmp!
