The file /usr/sbin/openarenaserver is a bash script and it reads from the
/opt/openarenaserver directory to execute every script in it and delete them.

Since user level05 has rwx access to the directory, simply create a script that
will call getflag and redirect the output into a file in the same directory.

The script is deleted after execution so you should be fast before the cronjob
(probably) removes the result file. That's it, enjoy your flag.
