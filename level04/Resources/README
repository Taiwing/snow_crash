welll that was easy

The perl script is a CGI file, it is used to render web pages dynamically.
The corresponding page, as it is nicely pointed out by the comment, is served
on localhost:4747. So just connect to <snow_crash_ip>:4747 in the brower to
access it.

There is nothing to be shown right now. But like in the last exercise, the perl
script has the suid bit on and belongs to flag04. In it I can see a backtick
syntax with an echo command and what looks like variable substitution with '$y'.

Basically, just give 'x=something' as a get paramter to the page to see
'something' in it through the echo command.

Since it's a shell command just pass ';getflag' to it. Like this:

<snow_crash_ip>:4747/?x=%3bgetflag

Where '3b' is the ascii hexcode for ';'. Then see the token :)
