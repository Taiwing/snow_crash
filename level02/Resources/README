- scp pcap file on host machine
- open with wireshark to see the packet history
- check TCP payloads for clear text
- see login:
- then some other stuff
- then Password:
- and see these weird one byte payloads
- take each one to build the password
- then see some '7f' bytes which are del characters
  which means the guy messed up while typing, so erase
  as many characters as there are '7f' chars
- reach the '0d'/form feed character and the password is complete !
