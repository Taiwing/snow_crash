Well this one is so easy I dont understand...

Well simply launch the binary with the debugger:

gdb ./level14

Break in main and dissassemble. Then set the next breakpoint just after the
first getuid call. Simply set the output register, eax, to 4242 and continue.

Then you get the token. You can connect to level14 directly with it.
