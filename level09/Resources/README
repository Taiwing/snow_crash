The objective seems to be loading a malicious library that will do the job to
execute getflag.

- ptrace is called, so no strace/ptrace/debugger magic
- LD_PRELOAD is checked, so probably no loading the lib that way
- /etc/ld.so.preload is checked too, and I dont have rights to /etc anyway

- this leaves only /proc/self/maps to do the job it would seem, but the file is
  not directly modfiable too, so it would seem to require a cleverer trick
