- run: gdb ./level03
- then, in gdb:
b main (set breakpoint in main)
run
- when reaching main breakpoint:
disassemble (lets you see the assembly instructions)
- copy the movl argument (address before %esp) just before system as this is
  the address of the command string in memory, then:
set { char[9] } 0x000000 = "getflag;" (replace 0x000000 by the actual address)
- then run and get the flag


- ALL THAT ABOVE IS SHIT
- just scp the echo script here to <snow_crash_ip>:/tmp
- then run in the vm run 'cd /tmp && chmod +x echo'
- go back to level03 directory
- run 'env PATH="/tmp" ./level03' and voila -_-
